   	<h1>Research Interests</h1>
	
	   <p>My research interests involve understanding and exploring complex social systems using computational methods, including 
	    agent-based modeling (ABM), social network analysis (SNA), and geographic information systems (GIS) to model human movement 
	    and behavior.
	
	<h2>Integration of ABM, SNA, and GIS</h2>
	      
	      <p> The integration of SNA and GIS in an ABM allows us to model agent-to-agent and
agent-to-environment interactions spatiotemporally. Moreover, it allows us to explore how social structures
(i.e., dynamic social networks) emerge from individual interactions over social (SNA) and physical
(GIS) space and examine the feedback loop between individual interaction and collective dynamics.
		      
	<h2>The Balance Between Theory and Data</h2>
	      <p>A unique advantage of computational modeling and agent-based modeling, specifically, is its ability to concurrently 
		      build theoretical and empirical models of social phenomena (Manson et al., 2012). 
		      Using a computational approach we can
		      develop “intermediate” models of social phenomena, which are 
		      explanatory in their intent to explore theory and descriptive in their use of empirical data to build the 
		      environment and create the agents. Intermediate models are flexible enough to apply general theories 
		      of human behavior and to test existing theory on environments that represent actual, real world 
		      settings. As such, 
		      they seek a balance between abstraction and reality. This balance provides a certain level 
		      of exploratory flexibility, but at the same time, grounds the model in reality. <!--The figure below illustrates
		      how different classication schemes 

The development of these models is facilated through the integration of ABM with SNA and GIS. 
		      
		      
		      
		<p>According to Axtell and Epstein (1994), this range can be described through four classification
			levels. These include Level 0 models, which represent a simple caricature of reality, Level 1
			models, which seek macro-level qualitative agreement with empirical structures, Level 2 models,
			which seek macro-level quantitative agreement with empirical data, and Level 3 models, which seek 
			micro-level quantitative agreement with empirical data. Parker et al. (2003), on the other
			hand, describes this range via an explanatory (i.e., applies some abstraction of reality) to descriptive
			(i.e., based on empirical details of the social phenomena) continuum. Similarly, Crooks and
			Castle (2012) developed a matrix categorized into four areas depending on whether the agents
			and/or the environment are designed (i.e., explanatory) or analyzed (i.e., descriptive). The purpose of the model, a
			rough placement of Axtell and Epstein’s (1994) classification scheme, and the verification and validation
			approach is shown in Figure 1 based on where the model fits in relation to the explanatory
			to descriptive spectrum.

	<h2>Working with "All" Data</h2>
	      <p>An important theme in my postdoc research has been the utility of applying "all" data, including administrative, opportunity, to problems 
		      in the social world.
