   	<h3>Modeling the Emergence of Riots</h3>
	
	   <p>This ABM serves as an initial prototype for modeling riots in an urban area, with the Kibera slum serving as 
		   the case study. It explores the role humanistic needs theory, individual identity, collective social identity, 
		   and social influence play on rumor dynamics and the spread of ethnic stereotyping in the outbreak of riots. 
		   An ABM is integrated with social network analysis (SNA) and geographic information systems (GIS) for this purpose.

<h3>Knowledge Sharing in a Hospital</h3>
	      <p>Organizational culture, informal roles, and individual attitudes
are key components that interact to influence organizational processes that lead to these
desired outcomes. In particular, culture, roles, and attitudes impact knowledge sharing, a process
that has been found to be vital to organizational performance and innovation. I am developing an agent-based model that is integrated
		      with dynamic social networks to explore attidue formation and the spread of knowledge 
		      through these networks. This work is currently be funded by the Army Research Institute.

	<h3>A Spatiotemporal Model for Individual Exposure to Ozone</h3>
	      <p>A spatiotemporal air quality model of ozone is coupled with a
synthetic information model for the Houston metropolitan area. Specific
exposure levels are attached to individuals based on the exact time of day and geolocation of the activity.
Maintaining the granularity of the data is critical to more accurately
reflect the heterogeneous exposure levels of the population across space and time within the
		      greater Houston area.

<h3>A Bayesian Approach for Supply Chain Synchronization</h3>
	      <p>A data informatics model that can be used to realize a digital synchronized supply
chain was developed. To realize this model, a hybrid model that combines Bayesian modeling with discrete-event
simulation is applied to the supply chain process at a Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) manufacturing
plant. Approximately one year of transactional data, including information on customer
orders, production, raw materials, inventory, and shipments are used. A driving force for creating this model is to
better understand Total Shareholder Return expressed in terms of cash, profit, and service.

	<h3>The Geography of Conflict Diamonds</h3>
	      
	      <p>In the early 1990s, Sierra Leone entered into nearly 10 years of civil war. The ease of accessibility 
		      to the country’s diamonds is said to have provided the funding needed to sustain the insurgency over 
		      the years. According to Le Billon, the spatial dispersion of a resource is a major defining feature of a war. 
		      Using geographic information systems to create a realistic landscape and theory to ground agent behavior, 
		      an agent-based model is developed to explore Le Billon’s claim. An ABM is integrated with geographic 
		      information systems (GIS) for this purpose.

	<h3>A Social Network Approach to Spatiotemporal Event Analysis</h3>
	      <p>While the covert nature of terrorist organizations makes obtaining individual level
association data difficult, increasing access to spatiotemporal event databases
provides the opportunity to explore such data. Using event data, a spatiotemporal
network model to explore the evolution of the FARC was developed. Results show
that through a coordinated effort, the base of the organization shifted southwest.

	<h3>Challenges and Opportunities for Modeling Violent Collective Action Computationally: Balancing Theory and Data</h3>
		<p>Conflict relates to the divergence
of interests; collective action relates to the mobilization
of a group with common interests. Violent collective action is a subfield of the broader conflict studies and collective action fields
An advantage of computational modeling is the ability to concurrently build theoretical and empirical models of social phenomena. 
			By balancing a normative, theoretic approach in driving agent behavior with a
positive, empirically grounded approach to creating the environment, we have
the opportunity to implement theory and relationships and explore theory in a
real world landscape through what if scenarios.

		    <h3>Exploring the Emergence of Organized Crime in Rio de Janeiro</h3>
		    <p>An agent-based model was developed to explore how
human needs, environmental factors, and individual attributes
impact state-level behaviors. The emergence of organized
crime is observed as agents turn into gang
members.
