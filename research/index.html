   	<h1>Research Interests</h1>
	
	   <p>My research interests involve understanding and exploring complex social systems using computational methods, including 
	    agent-based modeling (ABM), social network analysis (SNA), and geographic information systems (GIS) to model human movement 
	    and behavior.
	
	<h2>Integration of ABM, SNA, and GIS</h2>
	<h2>The Balance Between Theory and Data</h2>
	      <p>A unique advantage of computational modeling and agent-based modeling, specifically, is its ability to concurrently 
		      build theoretical and empirical models of social phenomena (Manson et al., 2012). 
		      Agent-based models can range from stylized, “toy” models that represent some caricature of reality to 
		      fully calibrated models that demonstrate quantitative agreement with micro-level processes 
		      (Axtell and Epstein, 1994; Parker et al., 2003; Crooks et al., 2008). Using a computational approach we can
		      develop “intermediate” models of violent collective action, which are 
		      explanatory in their intent to explore theory and descriptive in their use of empirical data to build the 
		      environment and create the agents. Intermediate models are flexible enough to apply general theories 
		      of human behavior and to test existing theory of conflict on environments that represent actual, real world 
		      settings. When model runs yield results representative of some macro phenomena seen in reality, support is 
		      given to the theory (Parker et al., 2003). While stylized models may prove difficult to translate to a real 
		      world situation, empirically detailed, fully calibrated models move away from theory. On the other hand, intermediate models are flexible in that they allow for a normative approach to conflicts in real 
		      world locations, potentially providing new insights into specific environments of conflict. As such, 
		      intermediate models seek a balance between abstraction and reality. This balance provides a certain level 
		      of exploratory flexibility, but at the same time, grounds the model in reality.
