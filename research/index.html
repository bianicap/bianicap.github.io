   	<h3>Modeling the Emergence of Riots TEST2</h3>
	
	   <p>This ABM serves as an initial prototype for modeling riots in an urban area, with the Kibera slum serving as the case study. It explores the role humanistic needs theory,individual identity, collective social identity, and social influence play on rumor dynamics and the spread of ethnic stereotyping in the outbreak of riots. An ABM is integrated with social network analysis (SNA) and geographic information systems (GIS) for this purpose.
	
	<h3>The Geography of Conflict Diamonds</h3>
	      
	      <p>In the early 1990s, Sierra Leone entered into nearly 10 years of civil war. The ease of accessibility to the country’s diamonds is said to have provided the funding needed to sustain the insurgency over the years. According to Le Billon, the spatial dispersion of a resource is a major defining feature of a war. Using geographic information systems to create a realistic landscape and theory to ground agent behavior, an agent-based model is developed to explore Le Billon’s claim. An ABM is integrated with geographic information systems (GIS) for this purpose. This is an exploratory model and was thus developed for researchers and students interested in agent-based modeling, specifically the role of geography in conflict.
		      
	<h3>A Social Network Approach to Spatiotemporal Event Analysis</h3>
	      <p>While the covert nature of terrorist organizations makes obtaining individual level
association data difficult, increasing access to spatiotemporal event databases
provides the opportunity to explore such data. Using event data, a spatiotemporal
network model to explore the evolution of the FARC was developed. Results show
that through a coordinated effort, the base of the organization shifted southwest.
This paper illustrates the insights gained by using network methods and
event data to study terrorist organizations and lays the foundation for future
work.

	<h3>A Spatiotemporal Model for Individual Exposure to Ozone</h3>
	      <p>A spatiotemporal air quality model of ozone is coupled with a
synthetic information model for the Houston metropolitan area. Specific
exposure levels are attached to individuals based on the exact time of day and geolocation of the activity.
Maintaining the granularity of the data is critical to more accurately
reflect the heterogeneous exposure levels of the population across space and time within the
		      greater Houston area.
	
	      <h3>A Bayesian Approach for Supply Chain Synchronization</h3>
	      <p>A data informatics model that can be used to realize a digital synchronized supply
chain was developed. To realize this model, a hybrid model that combines Bayesian modeling with discrete-event
simulation is applied to the supply chain process at a Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) manufacturing
plant. Approximately one year of transactional data, including information on customer
orders, production, raw materials, inventory, and shipments are used. A driving force for creating this model is to
better understand Total Shareholder Return expressed in terms of cash, profit, and service.
