  "body": "I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Social Decision Analytics Laboratory at Virginia Tech. Her research interests involves understanding and exploring complex social systems using computational methods, including agent-based modeling (ABM), social network analysis (SNA), and geographic information systems (GIS) to model human movement and behavior. As part of her dissertation, Dr. Pires developed an ABM using MASON (a multi-agent simulation library core in Java) to explore how the dynamics of an urban slum, human behavior, and the diffusion of a rumor can influence the emergence of riots. The development of an urban environment using crowdsourced data for the agents to move and interact was a key component of this model, including the creation of the transportation network and the geo-location of facilities. Agent behavior, grounded in theory, helped created dynamic social networks. Prior to her dissertation research, Dr. Pires spent nearly 10 years working in industry, where she gained extensive experience analyzing large datasets and developing industry ready simulation and statistical models. Dr. Pires holds a B.S. in Industrial & Systems Engineering, an M.A. in International Business from the University of Florida, and a Ph.D. in Computational Social Science from George Mason University.",
