      <section>
        <p>I'm a Research Scientist at the Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory in the Biocomplexity Institute of Virginia Tech. 
		My research interests involves 
		understanding and exploring complex social systems using computational methods, including agent-based modeling, 
		social network analysis, geographic information systems to model human movement and behavior. I have developed computational models
		that explore the emergence of riots, the simulate the diffusion of information, and that estimate individual exposure to
		pollutants. The development of a physical environment for the agents to move and 
		interact is a key component of many of my models, including the creation of the transportation network and the 
		geo-location of homes and facilities. Agent behavior, grounded in theory, helps create dynamic social networks. The physical 
	      environment, social networks, and individual traits influence decision-making processes, whether it is to spread a rumor,
	      join a riot, or share information.</p>
		<p>I hold a B.S. in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering from the University of Florida, M.A. in International Business from the University of Florida, 
		and Ph.D. in Computational Social Science from George Mason University.</p>
