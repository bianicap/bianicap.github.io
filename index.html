        <p>I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Social &amp; Decision Analytics Laboratory at Virginia Tech. 
        My research interests involve understanding and exploring complex social systems using computational methods, 
        including agent-based modeling (ABM), social network analysis (SNA), and geographic information systems (GIS) 
        to model human movement and behavior. 
	<p>As part of her dissertation, I developed an ABM using MASON 
        (a multi-agent simulation library core in Java) to explore how the dynamics of an urban slum, human behavior, opinion dynamics, 
		and the diffusion of a rumor can influence the emergence of riots. The development of an urban environment 
		using crowdsourced data for the agents to move and interact was a key component of this model, including the 
		creation of the transportation network and the geo-location of facilities. Agent behavior, grounded in theory, 
		helped created dynamic social networks. 
	<p>Prior to my dissertation research, I spent nearly 10 years working 
		in industry, where I gained extensive experience analyzing large datasets and developing industry ready simulation 
		and statistical models. I hold a B.S. in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering from the University of Florida, an M.A. in International 
		Business from the University of Florida, and a Ph.D. in Computational Social Science from George Mason University.</p>
